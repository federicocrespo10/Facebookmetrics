# facebook metrics

About the project:

This is a dataset taken from the University of California (UCI). https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/index.php?fbclid=IwAR1VyTWpIYHMpjOJ5Nd58B9OvwGaQIhoYDH-5i4kvSSAqqPFKGPApPicNyM, based on some Facebook metrics in a 500 dataset for businesses in Facebook.

I've created a small Explanatory Data Analysis, where I pointed out some outliers, explored some of the main features of the data, and visualized some particular metrics such as at what time most of the posts are, which month is the most popular in terms of posts, how many posts got comments and the feedback received in terms of likes.

It's a small but powerfull EDA
